# Brent Oil Price Change Point Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of geopolitical and economic events on Brent oil prices using Bayesian change point detection. The goal is to identify significant structural breaks in oil prices and correlate them with major events, providing actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and energy companies. Key challenges include distinguishing between correlation and causation and quantifying the impact of events on price fluctuations.

### Key Features:
- **Data Analysis**: Preprocesses historical Brent oil price data and compiles a dataset of key events.
- **Change Point Detection**: Implements Bayesian models to identify structural breaks in price trends.
- **Impact Quantification**: Measures the effect of events on oil prices using probabilistic statements.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes change points and associated events for stakeholder exploration.

## Key features:
- Event highlight and filtering
- Change point visualization
- Date range selection
